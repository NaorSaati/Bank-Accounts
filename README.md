# Bank-Accounts

This project involves developing an object-oriented banking system in Java, focusing on efficient data management through binary search trees and iterators. The system handles bank accounts using OOP principles, allowing for operations like filtering, sorting, and parallel processing of accounts. Databases could be integrated to persist account data, ensuring that information is stored, retrieved, and managed efficiently within the system. The project emphasizes data structure optimization, OOP design patterns, and the use of comparators for sorting and searching operations.
